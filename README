simple_flash: fix your Matshita DVD reader, under Linux


BACKGROUND

For no good reason, Matshita drives sometimes are unable to read
absolutely fine DVDs.  You can fix this by upgrading their
firmware; you can find suitable images online.

I couldn't find a flasher that works without Windows or MacOS.
So I fiddled a little bit.  Very little of this is actually my
own work:

* lscsi.c is part of the plscsi toolkit, by Pat LaVarre
(http://home.comcast.net/~plavarre/plscsi/)

* simple_flash.c, xscsi.h -- from the MacOS flasher by 'ben11'

Minimal tweaking to get it to compile and link by me,
simple_flash.x* are static binaries.


INVOCATION

Invoke like this:

./simple_flash.x64 /dev/sg1 UJXXXX_VERSION.dat

Where sg1 is the SCSI generic device for your DVD reader,
and the *dat a suitable firmware file.

Have fun, and don't fry your drive.  I hope you know
what you're doing, and I cannot accept responsibility
for any damage done.


TODO

port this to plscsi upstream and replace the struct sp
hack

firmware dumper

add a proper build system to build on Windows and MacOS
